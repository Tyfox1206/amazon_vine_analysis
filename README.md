# amazon_vine_analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
for deliverable 1 I took a large data dump provided by amazon and transformed the data and then worked with uploading it into an AWS RDS that can be accessed with pgadmin. I uploaded for tables into the AWS RDS, the tables are customers_table, products_table, review_id_table, and vine_table. below are images of each of the tables showing in pgadmin with populated data.
